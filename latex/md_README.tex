\subsection*{Overview}

This project attempts to implement a Perception module for A\+C\+ME Robotics using high-\/quality software engineering practices such as the Agile Iterative Process, Object Oriented Programming, Pair Programming and Test Driven Development. We will attempt to achieve robust human detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (H\+OG) feature descriptor combined with a Support Vector Machine Model. The algorithm uses H\+OG features extracted from the input data to detect Humans and surround them with rectangular bounding boxes, the centers of which act as the pixel coordinates of the detected humans. These coordinates combined with the pose matrix of the homogeneous transformation between the monocular camera and the 3D world will be used to track the detected humans. The pixel coordinates will be used for determining the distance of the humans with respect to the Robotâ€™s Reference Frame. Support Vector Machine classifier will be used to train the extracted H\+OG features to train the training data.

\subsection*{Technology Used}

We will be following the Agile Iterative Software Development Process and the Test Driven Development Process. We will plan the work in Sprints and switch between the roles of driver and navigator throughout the process.

\subsection*{Known Issues/\+Bugs}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Human Detection is not highly efficient; Unnecessary bounding boxes are drawn for detections other than humans.
\item Humans in an abnormal pose are not being detected.
